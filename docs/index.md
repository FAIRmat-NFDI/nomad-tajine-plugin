# Welcome to the `nomad-tajine-plugin` documentation

An example plugin showing how NOMAD can be used outside of material science for curating food recipes.

This is the documentation for the **NOMAD plugin for food recipes**, developed as part of the nomad-tajine hackathon. It provides a guide on how to use the plugin effectively to manage and share food recipe data in NOMAD.

This plugin was developed to demonstrate that [**NOMAD Oasis**](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/nomad-oasis.html) can serve as a domain-agnostic data management platform.  
As part of this demonstration, we created a dedicated instance of NOMAD Oasis [**nomad-tajine-distro**](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-tajine-distro), and this accompanying plugin, [**nomad-tajine-plugin**](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-tajine-plugin).

We hope this documentation helps you enjoy exploring and using the nomad-tajine-plugin.  
This plugin was created as a fun and creative experiment to show how NOMAD can be customized beyond science, in this case, to curate and share delicious food recipes!  
For questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-tajine-plugin), join the NOMAD Discord channel, or reach out directly to the [FAIRmat project](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/about-fairmat/contact-fairmat).
